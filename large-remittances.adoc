:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Introduction

This document outlines the system design considerations, architecture, and practical steps for building a remittance system capable of processing a very high number of transactions per day.

== Typical Daily Remittance Volumes

A large bank may process anywhere from hundreds of thousands to several million remittance transactions per day, depending on its size, customer base, and geographic reach.

- Typical daily volume: 500,000 to 5,000,000+ transactions
- Peak periods (e.g., month-end, holidays) may see even higher volumes

== Core Systems Involved

- Core Banking System: Manages customer accounts and balances.
- Payment Gateway: Interfaces with external payment networks (SWIFT, ACH, RTGS, etc.).
- Transaction Processing Engine: Orchestrates settlement, confirmation, and reconciliation.
- Message Queues/Event Streams: Enables asynchronous processing and decoupling of services.
- Monitoring & Alerting Platform: Tracks system health, performance, and failures.
- Data Warehousing/Analytics: Stores historical data for analysis and reporting.

== System Architecture

=== REST-Based Remittance System on JBoss

- Multiple WAR files, each providing a specific REST service (validation, balance check, gateway integration, notification, etc.).
- All services are deployed in a single JBoss application server instance.
- Services communicate via RESTful APIs.

==== Transaction Flow

. Validate customer information via a REST service.
. Check account balances.
. Send transaction details to an external payment gateway.
. Save the confirmation response to the database.
. Notify the customer of the transaction status.

==== Performance

- The system can process a complete transaction cycle (from request to customer notification) in approximately 900 milliseconds.

==== Key Considerations

- Ensure each service is stateless for scalability.
- Use connection pooling for database and gateway calls to maintain low latency.
- Monitor inter-service communication to avoid bottlenecks.
- Optimize thread pools and JBoss configuration for concurrent request handling.
- Regularly test and tune for throughput and latency targets.

== Measuring Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

=== Throughput

- Measure the number of remittance transactions processed per second/minute/hour.
- Example: To meet 100,000/day, the system should handle ~1.2 transactions/second (assuming 24/7 operation).

=== Latency

- Measure end-to-end time for a remittance to be settled and confirmed.
- Set targets (e.g., 95% of transactions confirmed within 5 seconds).

=== Availability

- Track system uptime using monitoring tools.
- Target high availability (e.g., 99.99%).

=== Scalability

- Perform load testing to verify the system can scale horizontally.
- Simulate peak loads and monitor resource utilization.

=== Reliability

- Monitor error rates, failed transactions, and recovery times.
- Implement automated alerting for failures.

=== Monitoring & Reporting

- Use dashboards to visualize throughput, latency, error rates, and resource usage.
- Regularly review metrics to ensure NFRs are met.

=== Example Measurement Steps

. Define NFR targets for throughput, latency, availability, etc.
. Instrument the system with logging and monitoring tools.
. Run load tests simulating 100,000+ daily transactions.
. Collect and analyze metrics.
. Tune system components to meet or exceed NFR targets.

== Strategies to Increase Throughput

- Horizontal scaling: Add more instances of stateless services and databases.
- Partitioning/sharding: Split data and workload across multiple database shards or service partitions.
- Asynchronous processing: Use message queues and event-driven architecture.
- Batch processing: Group and process remittance transactions in batches.
- Optimized data access: Use efficient indexing, caching, and minimize database round-trips.

- Database sharding: Partition data across multiple database servers.
- Distributed caching: Use distributed cache systems (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- Message queues: Use queues to decouple producers and consumers.
- Microservices architecture: Split functionality into independently deployable and scalable services.
- Auto-scaling: Use orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS).
- Geographical distribution: Deploy services in multiple regions.
- API gateways & load balancers: Route requests efficiently.
- Distributed file storage: Use distributed storage solutions for files and large objects.

== Managing a Large Number of REST API Endpoints

Effectively managing a large number of REST API endpoints is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and clarity in high-volume systems. Consider the following best practices:

- Modularization: Organize endpoints by functional domains or bounded contexts, grouping related APIs into separate modules or services.
- Versioning: Use clear API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) to manage changes and backward compatibility.
- Consistent Naming Conventions: Apply consistent and descriptive naming for resources and actions to improve discoverability and reduce confusion.
- API Gateway: Employ an API gateway to centralize routing, authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring for all endpoints.
- Documentation: Use tools like OpenAPI/Swagger to auto-generate and maintain up-to-date API documentation.
- Code Generation: Leverage code generation tools to reduce boilerplate and enforce consistency across endpoints.
- Pagination & Filtering: Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting for endpoints returning large datasets to optimize performance.
- Security: Apply consistent authentication and authorization mechanisms across all endpoints.
- Monitoring & Analytics: Track usage, errors, and performance metrics for each endpoint to identify bottlenecks and optimize hot paths.
- Deprecation Policy: Establish a clear process for deprecating and removing obsolete endpoints.

By following these practices, you can ensure your REST API remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to evolve as your system grows.

== Security Considerations

Security is critical in remittance systems to protect sensitive data and prevent fraud. Consider the following security measures:

- Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using strong encryption standards (e.g., AES, TLS).
- Authentication: Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) for users and systems.
- Authorization: Enforce fine-grained access control and permissions for resources and actions.
- Input Validation: Rigorously validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
- Logging and Monitoring: Maintain detailed logs of all transactions and access attempts. Monitor logs for suspicious activities.
- Fraud Detection: Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions (e.g., anomaly detection, transaction limits).
- Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
- Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, local financial regulations).

By incorporating these security measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and fraud in your remittance system.

== Performance Optimization Techniques

To achieve and maintain high performance in remittance systems, consider the following optimization techniques:

- Caching: Implement caching at multiple levels (e.g., database query results, API responses, static assets) to reduce latency and load.
- Load Balancing: Distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple servers or instances to prevent overload and ensure high availability.
- Database Optimization: Optimize database schema, queries, and indexes for fast data access. Consider read replicas for scaling reads.
- Code Optimization: Profile and optimize application code to reduce processing time and resource consumption.
- Network Optimization: Optimize network configuration and use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to reduce latency and improve data delivery speed.
- Compression: Use data compression (e.g., Gzip) for API responses and static assets to reduce payload size and accelerate transmission.
- Connection Pooling: Use connection pooling for databases and external services to reduce the overhead of establishing new connections.
- Asynchronous Processing: Offload time-consuming tasks to background processes or asynchronous workflows to free up resources for handling requests.
- Batch Processing: Process transactions in batches where possible to reduce overhead and improve throughput.

Regularly profile and monitor system performance to identify bottlenecks and validate the impact of optimization efforts.

== Testing Strategies for High-Volume Remittance Systems

Robust testing is essential to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of remittance systems. Consider the following testing strategies:

- Unit Testing: Test individual components and functions for correctness in isolation.
- Integration Testing: Test interactions between integrated components and external systems (e.g., payment gateways, databases).
- Functional Testing: Validate the system against business requirements and use cases.
- Performance Testing: Measure system performance (throughput, latency) under expected and peak loads.
- Load Testing: Simulate high transaction volumes to verify the system's behavior under stress.
- Security Testing: Assess the system for vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validate the system with end-users to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.
- Regression Testing: Ensure that new changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.

Automate testing where possible to improve efficiency and coverage. Regularly review and update test cases and scenarios to reflect changes in the system and business requirements.

== Deployment Strategies

Effective deployment strategies are crucial for delivering updates and new features with minimal disruption. Consider the following approaches:

- Blue-Green Deployments: Maintain two identical production environments (blue and green). Deploy updates to the inactive environment, then switch traffic to it after validation.
- Canary Releases: Gradually roll out changes to a small subset of users or transactions before a full-scale deployment.
- Rolling Updates: Update instances or components incrementally, ensuring that some instances remain available to handle requests.
- Feature Toggles: Use feature flags to enable or disable features at runtime, allowing for safe experimentation and gradual rollouts.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manage and provision infrastructure using code and automation tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) for consistency and repeatability.
- Containerization: Use containers (e.g., Docker) to package applications and dependencies for consistent deployment across environments.
- Orchestration: Use orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenShift) to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Carefully plan and test deployment strategies to minimize risks and ensure a smooth transition between application versions.

== Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Implementing CI/CD practices helps automate and streamline the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications. Consider the following CI/CD practices:

- Version Control: Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage source code and track changes.
- Automated Testing: Integrate automated tests (unit, integration, performance) into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality.
- Build Automation: Automate the build process to compile code, run tests, and package applications for deployment.
- Continuous Integration: Frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository, triggering automated builds and tests.
- Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploy passing builds to production or staging environments, based on defined policies and approvals.
- Monitoring and Alerts: Monitor CI/CD pipelines for failures and performance issues. Set up alerts for critical failures.

By adopting CI/CD practices, you can accelerate the delivery of new features and improvements while maintaining high quality and reliability.

== Cloud-Native Considerations

Designing remittance systems as cloud-native applications offers benefits such as scalability, flexibility, and resilience. Consider the following cloud-native principles:

- Microservices Architecture: Build applications as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
- Containerization: Package services and dependencies in containers for consistent deployment and scaling.
- Dynamic Orchestration: Use orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage the lifecycle, scaling, and networking of containers.
- Service Mesh: Implement a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) to manage service-to-service communication, security, and monitoring.
- API Gateway: Use an API gateway to manage external access to services, including routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
- Event-Driven Architecture: Use events and messaging for communication between services, enabling loose coupling and asynchronous processing.
- Resilience and Fault Tolerance: Design for failure by implementing retries, circuit breakers, and failover mechanisms.
- Observability: Implement centralized logging, monitoring, and tracing to gain insights into system behavior and performance.

By following cloud-native principles, you can build remittance systems that are scalable, resilient, and easier to manage in dynamic cloud environments.

== Typical Oracle Database Call Latency

The time taken for an Oracle database call can vary widely depending on several factors:

- Simple SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE: Typically 5–20 milliseconds for well-indexed, small transactions under normal load.
- Complex Queries/Joins: Can range from tens to hundreds of milliseconds, or more if the query is not optimized.
- Network Latency: Adds overhead if the application server and database are on different hosts or data centers.
- Connection Pooling: Reduces latency by reusing connections, avoiding the overhead of establishing new ones.
- Database Load: High concurrency, locking, or resource contention can increase response times.
- Configuration & Tuning: Proper indexing, query optimization, and hardware resources help minimize latency.

For high-throughput, low-latency systems, aim for database calls to complete in under 20 milliseconds for simple operations, and continuously monitor and optimize for consistent performance.

== Using Netty within JBoss via Spring Boot

Netty can be used as the underlying HTTP server for a Spring Boot application. If you want to run such an application within a JBoss environment, you typically package your Spring Boot app as a WAR file and deploy it to JBoss. However, by default, JBoss will use its own servlet container (Undertow or similar) to handle HTTP requests.

To leverage Netty inside JBoss, consider the following approaches:

- Standalone Spring Boot with Netty: Run your Spring Boot application as a standalone service (using the embedded Netty server) outside of JBoss.
- Spring Boot WAR in JBoss: Deploying a WAR disables embedded Netty; JBoss's servlet engine handles HTTP requests.
- Internal Netty Usage: Use Netty for internal networking (e.g., async messaging) within your app, even in JBoss.
- Proxy Approach: Deploy Netty-based Spring Boot service separately and use JBoss as a gateway/proxy.

Netty cannot directly replace the JBoss HTTP engine when deploying a WAR. For full Netty capabilities, run your Spring Boot app as a standalone service.

== Deployment on Bare Metal Linux (RHEL)

Deploying a high-volume remittance system on bare metal Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) servers offers direct control over hardware resources, OS tuning, and network configuration.

=== Resource Allocation

- Allocate dedicated CPU, memory, and storage for critical components (e.g., JBoss, databases) to avoid contention.

=== OS Tuning

- Increase file descriptors (`ulimit -n`) for concurrent connections.
- Adjust process/thread limits (`ulimit -u`).
- Tune TCP parameters and network buffers.
- Enable interrupt coalescing and optimize NIC settings.
- Adjust kernel parameters in `/etc/sysctl.conf`.
- Configure NUMA awareness for multi-socket systems.
- Use deadline or noop I/O schedulers for SSD/NVMe.
- Enable HugePages for large memory allocations.
- SSH Key Management: Use secure, unique keys, rotate regularly, and restrict permissions.
- Host File Management: Maintain `/etc/hosts` for static mappings, ensure consistency.
- iptables Management: Restrict network access, define explicit rules, use `firewalld` for management.
- Securing Network Communication: Use `stunnel` for SSL/TLS, or alternatives like OpenSSL, Nginx, HAProxy, SSH tunneling, socat, or VPNs.

=== Storage and Redundancy

- Use RAID 10 for performance and redundancy.
- Prefer NVMe/SSD for low-latency, high-throughput storage.
- Configure multipath I/O for redundancy in SAN.
- Use XFS or ext4 filesystems, tuned for workload.
- Implement database-level replication for high availability.
- Schedule regular, automated backups and test restores.
- Use snapshots for fast recovery.
- Deploy UPS and redundant power supplies.

By carefully tuning the OS and designing robust storage and redundancy strategies, you can ensure your remittance system delivers consistent performance and high availability even under demanding conditions.
